     ~ The :construct Programming Language ~
             ~ Erlang / Python / C ~

* A functional programming language based on Erlang
* Compiler and reference implementation in Python
* Optimized Virtual Machines for all Platforms in C

## Description ##

:cpl is a all-new project devoted to the
[Demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene). It's goal is to provide a
programming language and runtime system specifically designed for Demos, i.e.
non-interactive multimedia presentations on computers. Furthermore, :cpl is
compiled to byte-code which runs in its own virtual machine - this means that
Demos written in :cpl can theoretically run on any platform for which the VM can
be implemented.

## The Name ##

:cpl stands for :construct programming language. It is normally written using
a triangular colon and small caps. In its ASCII representation, a regular colon
and lower case letters are used instead, to maintain the type face.

:construct, on the other hand, is the brand of a (planned) Demotool which
incorporates :cpl in a visual programming environment. All elements and building
blocks seen in :construct ultimately render to :cpl code which is executed
within the :cpl virtual machine. While :cpl is open source, :construct will be
kept closed source until its first version is publically released. Also, some
virtual machine implementations and forks will be kept closed source.

## The "Team" ##

The demogroup puls:r is currently a one-man show or one-man army represented by
its founder p2k. I do have some friends and groupies which might join
later, though.

If you're a highly motivated programmer who wants to go this long way from zero
to the tops together with me, feel free to contact. If you can show some
commitment, you're in. An amazing time might just lie ahead of us.

Of course, you can also
[fork the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/p2k/CPL) and contribute
openly at any time. Your name will be shown in the credits if you can add some
valuable bits to this software.

For the reference, I also have created a group entry on
[pouet.net](http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=7841).

## Contact ##

* Jabber/XMPP: p2k@jabber.p2k-network.org
* IRC: #CPL on irc.hackint.eu - open discussion 24/7
* [Message via GitHub](https://github.com/inbox/new/p2k)
* I'll be at the [Evoke 2011](http://www.evoke.eu/2011/) in person. Seek out for
  a humble guy with a 27" iMac wearing a T-shirt with Mega Man on it - he's my
  permanent avatar and symbol.
