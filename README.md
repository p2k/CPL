     ~ The :construct Programming Language ~
             ~ Erlang / Python / C ~

* A functional programming language based on Erlang
* Compiler and reference implementation in Python
* Optimized Virtual Machines for all Platforms in C (and ASM)

## Description ##

:cpl is a all-new project devoted to the
[Demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene). It's goal is to provide a
programming language and runtime system specifically designed for Demos, i.e.
non-interactive multimedia presentations on computers. Furthermore, :cpl is
compiled to byte-code which runs in its own virtual machine - this means that
Demos written in :cpl can theoretically run on any platform for which the VM can
be implemented. Needles to say, this is a completely new but yet promising
approach; we will see how far it can get.

## The Name ##

:cpl stands for :construct programming language. It is normally written using
a triangular colon and small caps. In its ASCII representation, a regular colon
and lower case letters are used instead, to maintain the type face. Whenever a
colon cannot be used (folder names, URLs, etc.) the name is spelled in
uppercase, as an exception.

:construct, on the other hand, is the brand of a (planned) Demotool which
incorporates :cpl in a visual programming environment. All elements and building
blocks seen in :construct ultimately render to :cpl code which is executed
within the :cpl virtual machine. While :cpl is open source, :construct will be
kept closed source, but will be released as freeware once the first version is
completed.

Also other parts might get factored out as freeware later (e.g. the software
synthesizer). Sharing functions and modules in either binary or source form for
any platform is particularly easy with :cpl due to its design.

## The "Team" ##

The demogroup puls:r is currently a one-man show or one-man army represented by
its founder p2k. I consider it an open group for collaborative releases under
one name.

If you're a highly motivated coder/musician/graphic designer who wants to go
this long way from zero to the tops together with me, feel free to contact.
If you can show some commitment, you're in. An amazing time might just lie
ahead of us.

Of course, you can also
[fork the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/p2k/CPL) and contribute
openly at any time. Your name will be shown in the credits if you can add some
valuable bits to this software.

For the reference, I also have created a group entry on
[pouet.net](http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=7841).
